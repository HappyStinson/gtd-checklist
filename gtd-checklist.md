### Eisenhower Priority Matrix

#### The 'Important' Checklist (@Important)

- It will effect many people or projects if incomplete
- Other tasks depend on its completion
- It contributes a lot of value
- It's low effort-high results (80/20 principle)

#### The 'Urgent' Checklist (@Urgent)

- It is overdue
- It is due soon
- It demands immediate attention
- The consequences of not doing it are immediate

To apply the matrix to your to-do list, use tags to denote which quadrant of the matrix it falls into. From top right to left, you've got:

1. Urgent AND important
2. Important NOT urgent
3. Urgent NOT important
4. NOT urgent OR important
